Will this be enough to silence those calling for the UK and US to curb their arms sales to Saudi Arabia?</p><p>Unlikely. As long as air strikes continue over Yemen civilians will continue to die, while Houthi rebels continue to fire their missiles across the border at Saudi villages. So the pressure to end this unwinnable war is greater than ever.</p><p><a href="/news/magazine-37429043" class="story-body__link">One woman's lonely struggle against famine in Yemen</a></p><p><a href="/news/world-middle-east-35901321" class="story-body__link">A year of war that has set Yemen back decades</a></p><p><a href="/news/world-middle-east-35608328" class="story-body__link">Practising medicine under fire in Yemen</a></p><hr class="story-body__line"><p>The conflict in Yemen pits forces loyal to the internationally recognised government of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi against Houthi rebels. </p><p>The coalition led by Saudi Arabia accuses Iran of backing the rebels and supports the president. </p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-29319423" class="story-body__link">Yemen crisis: Who is fighting whom</a></p><figure class="media-landscape has-caption full-width">
