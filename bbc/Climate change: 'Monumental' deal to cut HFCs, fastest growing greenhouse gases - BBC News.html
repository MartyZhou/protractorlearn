The target of cutting global warming by 0.5 degrees may not be realised. </p><p>"They needed an agreement here as it's seen as an Obama legacy, so the US delegation has been pretty aggressive in making China and India get to an agreement," said Paula Tejon Carbajal from Greenpeace International.</p><p>"It's an incremental step towards 0.5 degrees but its not there yet, they say that the market will work to get us there, but we are not there yet."</p><p>The US Secretary of State believes that the science underpinning the deal is sound. He is confident that it will have a huge impact on warming. </p><p> "I feel very positive about where we are, we ran all the numbers and everybody feels confident that the integrity of the substance of this is there," he told the BBC.</p><p>Supporters argue that this agreement in Kigali will build on the foundations laid by the Paris climate agreement, signed by over 190 countries last December, and which becomes operational early in November. </p><p>They also point to the past history of the Montreal Protocol - over 100 fluorinated gases have been eliminated in the agreement's 30 year history. Once the regulation has been passed, industry rapidly develops alternatives. </p><p>"The market is going to wash over India, and will sweep them along, they will make the transition a lot faster than the number they put up," said Durwood Zaelke.</p><p>"Phase-outs have always driven the market transition so the laggards will be moved along by the market."</p><p>There was a sense of quiet jubilation among delegates here when the deal was finally gavelled through in the early hours of Saturday morning. </p><p>'It's a big deal," one observer said, "but it could have been bigger."</p><p>Follow Matt on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/MattMcGrathBBC" class="story-body__link-external">@mattmcgrathBBC</a> and on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCMattMcGrath/" class="story-body__link-external">Facebook</a>.</p>
