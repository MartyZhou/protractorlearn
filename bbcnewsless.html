</ul><hr class="story-body__line"><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">At the scene: Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Manchester, New Hampshire</h2><p>The rally was packed with students from across the political spectrum, including a young Republican who told me he was disgusted by Donald Trump, but yet to be convinced by Hillary Clinton. </p><p>As Michelle Obama entered the room, the deafening screams were at the sort of ear piercing level, usually reserved for rock stars. &nbsp;</p><p>And it was to this backdrop, the First Lady expressed her revulsion at Donald Trump's comments about women, as heard on that recently released tape. </p><p>She spoke with emotion, energy, and from the heart, but didn't name Mr Trump once - referring to him instead, as the candidate. </p><p>But aside from expressing her distaste at the Republican nominee's tone this election-&nbsp; she had another important message to those in the room. &nbsp;</p><p>That they must vote. Turnout, she said, was key. It's what helped her husband win this state of New Hampshire, and will be crucial for Hillary Clinton too. </p><p>In some precincts her husband won by an average of only 66 votes. Every ballot can make a difference, she urged the crowd. </p><p>If Mrs Obama really is a secret weapon for the Clinton campaign, then the true measure of how powerful her sermon was, will be tested in how she manages to rally the Democratic base. &nbsp;</p><hr class="story-body__line"><p>Two women <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0" class="story-body__link-external">told the New York Times</a> that the Republican presidential candidate groped or kissed them.</p><p>A <a href="http://people.com/politics/donald-trump-attacked-people-writer/" class="story-body__link-external">People magazine reporter also said</a> she was forcibly kissed, while another woman said Mr Trump grabbed her bottom.</p><p>Making his first public appearance since the allegations were made, Mr Trump told a rally in West Palm Beach these stories were "a conspiracy against the American people" by the political and media establishment. </p><p>He said he had evidence the accusations were unfounded and would release that at the "appropriate time".</p><p>In one reference, he appeared to imply People writer Natasha Stoynoff could not have been telling the truth because of her appearance.</p><p>"Take a look. You take a look. Look at her, look at her words, you tell me what you think. I don't think so, I don't think so."</p><figure class="media-with-caption">
